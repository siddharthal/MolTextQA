Ketorolac tromethamine, a non-selective inhibitor of the cyclooxygenases (COX), inhibits both COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes. This agent exerts its anti-inflammatory effect by preventing conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins at inflammation site mediated through inhibition of COX-2, which is undetectable in most tissues but is up-regulated at the inflammation sites. Since COX-1 is expressed virtually in all tissues, inhibition of COX-1 enzyme by this agent prevents normal state production of prostaglandins, which plays housekeeping roles in the protection of the gastrointestinal tract, regulating renal blood flow, and functioning in platelet aggregation. As a result, inhibition of COX-1 is usually associated with adverse effects such as gastrointestinal toxicity and nephrotoxicity.

This molecule is not FDA approved, but is approved in Canada.This molecule is a first-generation bisphosphonate with anti-resorptive and anti-hypercalcemic activities. Clodronic acid adsorbs onto the surface of the hydroxyapatite crystals in bone matrix. Although the exact mechanism through which clodronic acid exerts its cytotoxic effect on osteoclasts has yet to be fully elucidated, this agent is metabolized intracellularly to a toxic beta-gamma-methylene analog of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), AppCCl2p. The ATP analog AppCCl2p competitively inhibits ADP/ATP translocase, thereby interfering with mitochondrial membrane potential and cellular energy metabolism. This may cause osteoclast apoptosis and, eventually, inhibiting osteoclast-mediated bone resorption.This molecule is only found in individuals that have used or taken this drug. It is a diphosphonate which affects calcium metabolism. It inhibits bone resorption and soft tissue calcification. [PubChem]The bisphosphonate group binds strongly to the bone mineral, hydroxyapatite. This explains the specific pharmacological action of these compounds on mineralized tissues, especially bone. The exact mechanism of action of clodronate is not known, however it is known that it does not inhibit protein isoprenylation but can be metabolized intracellularly to a &beta;-&gamma;-methylene (AppCp-type) analog of ATP (AppCCl2p), which is cytotoxic to macrophages in vitro. Inhibition of the ADP/ATP translocase by the metabolite AppCCl2p is a likely route by which clodronate causes osteoclast apoptosis and inhibits bone resorption. Recently, the slime mold <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> was shown to take up bisphosphonates by pinocytosis. In these cells, clodronate, but not other pharmacologically active bisphosphonates, was incorporated into adenine nucleotides, which could potentially explain why this bisphosphonate sometimes seems to act differently than the other bisphosphonates. This molecule, like all biphosphonates, also binds protein-tyrosine-phosphatase.

Used for the treatment of ALK-positive metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent and an EC 2.7.10.1 (receptor protein-tyrosine kinase) inhibitor. It is an aminopyrimidine, an aromatic ether, an organochlorine compound, a secondary amino compound, a member of piperidines and a sulfone.This molecule is used for the treatment of adults with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) following failure (secondary to resistance or intolerance) of prior crizotinib therapy. About 4% of patients with NSCLC have a chromosomal rearrangement that generates a fusion gene between EML4 (echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4) and ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase), which results in constitutive kinase activity that contributes to carcinogenesis and seems to drive the malignant phenotype. This molecule exerts its therapeutic effect by inhibiting autophosphorylation of ALK, ALK-mediated phosphorylation of the downstream signaling protein STAT3, and proliferation of ALK-dependent cancer cells. Following treatment with crizotinib (a first-generation ALK inhibitor), most tumours develop drug resistance due to mutations in key ""gatekeeper"" residues of the enzyme. This occurrence led to development of novel second-generation ALK inhibitors such as ceritinib to overcome crizotinib resistance. The FDA approved ceritinib in April 2014 due to a surprisingly high response rate (56%) towards crizotinib-resistant tumours and has designated it with orphan drug status.This molecule is a Kinase Inhibitor. The mechanism of action of ceritinib is as a Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor, and Cytochrome P450 3A Inhibitor, and Cytochrome P450 2C9 Inhibitor.This molecule is an orally available inhibitor of the receptor tyrosine kinase activity of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) with antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, ceritinib binds to and inhibits wild-type ALK kinase, ALK fusion proteins and ALK point mutation variants. Inhibition of ALK leads to both the disruption of ALK-mediated signaling and the inhibition of cell growth in ALK-overexpressing tumor cells. ALK belongs to the insulin receptor superfamily and plays an important role in nervous system development. ALK dysregulation and gene rearrangements are associated with a variety of tumor cell types.

78,34,"These molecules is an organochlorine compound that is methylene chloride in which both hydrogens are replaced by phosphonic acid groups. It inhibits bone resorption and soft tissue calcification, and is used (often as the disodium salt tetrahydrate) as an adjunct in the treatment of severe hypercalcaemia associated with malignancy, and in the management of osteolytic lesions and bone pain associated with skeletal metastases. It has a role as a bone density conservation agent and an antineoplastic agent. It is an organochlorine compound, a one-carbon compound and a 1,1-bis(phosphonic acid). It is a conjugate acid of a clondronate(2-).This molecule is a first generation bisphosphonate similar to [etidronic acid] and [tiludronic acid]. These drugs were developed to mimic the action of pyrophosphate, a regulator of calcification and decalcification. clodronate’s use has decreased over the years in favor of the third generation, nitrogen containing bisphosphonate [zoledronic acid], [ibandronic acid], [minodronic acid], and [risedronic acid].  This molecule is not FDA approved, but is approved in Canada.This molecule is a first-generation bisphosphonate with anti-resorptive and anti-hypercalcemic activities. Clodronic acid adsorbs onto the surface of the hydroxyapatite crystals in bone matrix. Although the exact mechanism through which clodronic acid exerts its cytotoxic effect on osteoclasts has yet to be fully elucidated, this agent is metabolized intracellularly to a toxic beta-gamma-methylene analog of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), AppCCl2p. The ATP analog AppCCl2p competitively inhibits ADP/ATP translocase, thereby interfering with mitochondrial membrane potential and cellular energy metabolism. This may cause osteoclast apoptosis and, eventually, inhibiting osteoclast-mediated bone resorption.This molecule is only found in individuals that have used or taken this drug. It is a diphosphonate which affects calcium metabolism. It inhibits bone resorption and soft tissue calcification. [PubChem]The bisphosphonate group binds strongly to the bone mineral, hydroxyapatite. This explains the specific pharmacological action of these compounds on mineralized tissues, especially bone. The exact mechanism of action of clodronate is not known, however it is known that it does not inhibit protein isoprenylation but can be metabolized intracellularly to a &beta;-&gamma;-methylene (AppCp-type) analog of ATP (AppCCl2p), which is cytotoxic to macrophages in vitro. Inhibition of the ADP/ATP translocase by the metabolite AppCCl2p is a likely route by which clodronate causes osteoclast apoptosis and inhibits bone resorption. Recently, the slime mold <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> was shown to take up bisphosphonates by pinocytosis. In these cells, clodronate, but not other pharmacologically active bisphosphonates, was incorporated into adenine nucleotides, which could potentially explain why this bisphosphonate sometimes seems to act differently than the other bisphosphonates. This molecule, like all biphosphonates, also binds protein-tyrosine-phosphatase.

It is characterized as a white solid, and exposure occurs by inhalation, ingestion, or contact.This molecule is a carbamate pesticide. Carbamate pesticides are derived from carbamic acid and kill insects in a similar fashion as organophosphate insecticides. They are widely used in homes, gardens and agriculture. The first carbamate, carbaryl, was introduced in 1956 and more of it has been used throughout the world than all other carbamates combined. Because of carbaryl's relatively low mammalian oral and dermal toxicity and broad control spectrum, it has had wide use in lawn and garden settings. Most of the carbamates are extremely toxic to Hymenoptera, and precautions must be taken to avoid exposure to foraging bees or parasitic wasps. Some of the carbamates are translocated within plants, making them an effective systemic treatment. (L795)

Upon administration, duvelisib prevents the activation of the PI3K delta/gamma-mediated signaling pathways which may lead to a reduction in cellular proliferation in PI3K delta/gamma-expressing tumor cells. Unlike other isoforms of PI3K, the delta and gamma isoforms are overexpressed primarily in hematologic malignancies and inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. By selectively targeting these PI3K isoforms, PI3K signaling in normal, non-neoplastic cells is minimally or not affected which would result in a more favorable side effect profile.

85,56,"This molecule is an oral antiviral drug used in the treatment of human smallpox infections. It is a lipid conjugate pro-drug of the acyclic nucleotide analogue [cidofovir] - this lipid conjugate improves drug delivery to the target cells and significantly reduces the nephrotoxicity typically associated with cidofovir therapy. Due to its formulation as a pro-drug brincidofovir also carries a greater bioavailability than cidofovir, allowing for oral administration rather than intravenous. Cidofovir itself has broad antiviral activity against several DNA viruses, resulting in brincidofovir being investigated for the prevention and treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV), BK Virus (BKV), adenoviruses (AdV), and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), amongst others.  This molecule, developed by Chimerix under the brand name Tembexa, was approved by the FDA for the treatment of smallpox infection in June 2021. As smallpox has been eradicated, the efficacy of Tembexa was assessed in animals infected with viruses closely related to variola. The approval was granted under the agency’s Animal Rule, which allows for a drug to be approved based on the results of well-controlled animal studies when human trials would be unethical or infeasible.This molecule is an alkoxyalkyl ester prodrug containing the synthetic, acyclic nucleoside monophosphate analog cidofovir linked, through its phosphonate group, to a lipid, 3-hexadecyloxy-1-propanol, with antiviral activity against double-stranded DNA viruses. Upon oral administration, brincidofovir crosses the intestinal wall and penetrates target viral-infected cells before being cleaved to the free antiviral agent cidofovir. In turn, cidofovir is phosphorylated by pyruvate kinases to its active metabolite cidofovir diphosphate. Cidofovir diphosphate, bearing structural similarity to nucleotides, competes with deoxycytosine-5-triphosphate (dCTP) for viral DNA polymerase and gets incorporated into the growing viral DNA strands. As a result, it prevents further DNA polymerization and disrupts DNA replication of viruses. Compared to cidofovir, which is given intravenously, hexadecyloxypropyl-cidofovir shows better oral bioavailability, less toxicity and enhanced cellular penetration.This molecule is an orally available antiviral agent with activity against smallpox and several other DNA viruses that is currently approved for use against smallpox virus (variola) infection in humans and has been given emergency use authorization for treatment of monkeypox (now renamed “mpox”) infection.

It has a role as a local anaesthetic, an anti-arrhythmia drug, an environmental contaminant, a xenobiotic and a drug allergen. It is a monocarboxylic acid amide, a tertiary amino compound and a member of benzenes. It is functionally related to a glycinamide.Ever since its discovery and availability for sale and use in the late 1940s, lidocaine has become an exceptionally commonly used medication. In particular, lidocaine's principal mode of action in acting as a local anesthetic that numbs the sensations of tissues means the agent is indicated for facilitating local anesthesia for a large variety of surgical procedures. It ultimately elicits its numbing activity by blocking sodium channels so that the neurons of local tissues that have the medication applied on are transiently incapable of signaling the brain regarding sensations. In doing so, however, it can block or decrease muscle contractile, resulting in effects like vasodilation, hypotension, and irregular heart rate, among others. As a result, lidocaine is also considered a class Ib anti-arrhythmic agent. Nevertheless, lidocaine's local anesthetic action sees its use in many medical situations or circumstances that may benefit from its action, including the treatment of premature ejaculation.  Regardless, lidocaine is currently available as a relatively non-expensive generic medication that is written for in millions of prescriptions internationally on a yearly basis. It is even included in the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines.This molecule is an Amide Local Anesthetic and Antiarrhythmic. The physiologic effect of lidocaine is by means of Local Anesthesia.This molecule is a synthetic aminoethylamide with local anesthetic and antiarrhythmic properties. This molecule stabilizes the neuronal membrane by binding to and inhibiting voltage-gated sodium channels, thereby inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses and effecting local anesthesia.This molecule is only found in individuals that have used or taken this drug. It is a local anesthetic and cardiac depressant used as an antiarrhythmia agent. Its actions are more intense and its effects more prolonged than those of procaine but its duration of action is shorter than that of bupivacaine or prilocaine. This molecule stabilizes the neuronal membrane by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses thereby effecting local anesthetic action. This molecule alters signal conduction in neurons by blocking the fast voltage gated sodium (Na+) channels in the neuronal cell membrane that are responsible for signal propagation. With sufficient blockage the membrane of the postsynaptic neuron will not depolarize and will thus fail to transmit an action potential. This creates the anaesthetic effect by not merely preventing pain signals from propagating to the brain but by aborting their birth in the first place.
